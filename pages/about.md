lead: <b>Heya!</b> I go by Melody (or Victor) and use they/them pronouns. I've been doing web development seriously for over 8 years and before that I still couldn't put my computer away. I was always doing web development in my free time, and even in class! It was something I was and am very passionate about today, so I decided to make it my career. <br> <br> I sell my services to clients all across the US &amp; Canada. One day I hope to be able to travel and meet new people around the world.

# What I Do
​
​ I (mostly) specialize in web design and development! Here's a taste of what I do:

- **Web Development!** :earth_americas: This is the core of what I do, and because of that I make an effor to keep up with the latest in an ever-changing field. From the frontend to backend and everything in between, I can make magic happen.
- **UI/UX Design!** :joy: I build products with humans in mind - with simple, straightforward, and joyful user interfaces. The general rule of thumb is that if you need to explain how to use your product, then it’s too complex.
- **Community Management!**  :loudspeaker: I enjoy organizing community events to bring like-minded people together. I have launched numerous events and meetup groups, such as [TacoJS](/tacojs), [CodeDay Philly](/codeday), [High School Hackers](http://nyc.hshackers.org/hs-hack-exchange/), and more.

# What I am Learning

I consider myself to be a lifetime learner. Here are skills I am working on improving in the near future:

- **Illustration!**  :art: I am learning how to draw, one line at a time, with friends from wonderful communities such as Draw a Box and MLP Drawing School. I eventually want to get to the point where I can sell art and illustration as a skill to others, and to fans around the world.
- **Psychology!**  :necktie: I want to understand why people do things the way they do, not just in the physical world but also digital world.  That’s why I am studying human computer-interaction in my free time, to better understand the diverse mindset of users.

# Things I Love

This can be summed up in 4 words:

- **Unicorns!** :unicorn:
- **Tacos!** :taco:
- **Space!** :star:
- **Splatoon!** :star:
